GitHub Issues is for reporting bugs in **NSDictionary-ANDYSafeValue** and discussing features. Be sure to check our [documentation](http://cocoadocs.org/docsets/NSDictionary-ANDYSafeValue), [FAQ](https://github.com/NSDictionary-ANDYSafeValue/NSDictionary-ANDYSafeValue/wiki/FAQ) and [past issues](https://github.com/NSDictionary-ANDYSafeValue/NSDictionary-ANDYSafeValue/issues?state=closed) before opening any new issues.

If you are posting about a crash in your application, a stack trace is helpful, but additional context, in the form of code and explanation, is necessary to be of any use.

Please do not post any general usage questions to GitHub Issues, but instead take them to an appropriate forum such as [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/NSDictionary-ANDYSafeValue).
